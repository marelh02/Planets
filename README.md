Hello! My name is Elhilali Marouane, I'm a comp-sci student at Mohammedia School for Engineering aka EMI in Morocco.
This is my first time putting one of my projects in Github.

Anyway, this three js project emulates the movement of the planets in the solar system.
I didn't use anything fancy, just some geometries, materials and wrapped everything together in their own mesh,
since three js doesn't allow you to have more than one 3D object to  orbit around another one, I had to create a non-visible object
that has the same position as the sun for every planet, I set the planet to rotate around itself, and around its own object at the same time. As for the starry background, imagine that I put the solar system in a box, with a starry photo on every side.
You do get the gist of it by now.
